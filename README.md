## Introduction
Here is an attempt at creating a dual lora gateway for the Pi Zero as I wanted something small to track up to two trackers at once. Potentially from my pocket while I am running around a field looking for the trackers!! This board was intended to be used along with Dave Akermans LoRa Gateway software he developed for the Pi in The Sky project (https://github.com/PiInTheSky/lora-gateway.git) 

# Component Requirements 
1 x 24x2 pin header (female) 
1 x LoRa Chip (HopeRF) 
1 x SMA connector 
4 x 0805 SMD LEDs and appropriate resistors (optional) 

# Gerbers and boards 
For those of you familiar with board fabricators such as JLCPCB etc there is a gerber file for you to upload to get the board printed to make your own gateway. However boards are also available from my Ko-Fi page here:

# Setting up the Gateway
Once you have soldered up the board, you will need to install the LoRa Gateway software on your pi, Daves written a very easy to follow blog post about it here;
